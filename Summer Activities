Summer Activties
Spencer Naugler
    This summer I was involved in a decent ammount of tomfoolery. I mostly worked at my 40 hour job, but in-between was a blast.
    I was able to exercise every day and build my physique
    I joined a local dnd group at my hometown and got involved in an ongoing campaign
    Finally, I participated in the National Cyber League Tournament.
