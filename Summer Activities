Summer Activties

    Over the summer, I took 2 online classes: Web Programming and American Sign Language 2. I enjoyed them both :)

    This summer I visited Gatlenburg Tennasee. It was a total blast. I just turned 21 a year earlier, and I got to go to my first liquor tasting.
    After that I worked a lot!!! It was tedious, but what most people don't consider is how fulfilling that kind of life can be.
    You live your life in your 30 minute breaks, so you are kind of forced to make the most out of that time.
    After the intense work period I worked on hacking skills!
